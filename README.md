## About Me

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate working on Clinical NLP and Medical AI in [UW ICU Data Science Lab](https://icu.wisc.edu/), Department of Medicine, School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH), at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, with a focus on Natural Language Processing and AI in [NLP Lab](https://nlplab.psu.edu/), led by [Dr. Rebecca J. Passonneau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dPJ6mFsAAAAJ&hl=en), at Pennsylvania State University. My research areas include Natural Language Generation, Semantic Representation, Summarization Evaluation, Graph-based NLP, and AI applications in medicine and education. My name in Chinese is 高艳珺.

My favorite sentence as a computational linguist: “Doc, Note: I Dissent. A Fast Never Prevents A Fatness. I Diet On Cod.” – Garfield.

I'll be joining the University of Colorado Department of Biomedical Informatics (Anschutz Campus) as an Assistant Professor in the Fall of 2024. Prospective postdocs and students are welcome to email me at yanjun dot gao at cuanschutz dot edu.
